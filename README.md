This describes the Knapsack algorithm and the optimal path allowing us to determine which items exactly we have to take out.
The algorithm is written in C++, however, to play with SWIG, you can call the libraries in Python!

Just execute ./script.sh and then, either launch 'python test.py', or your own python script.


(Still in trial...)
