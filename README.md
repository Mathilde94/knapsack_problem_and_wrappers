In the Knapsack directory are some tests for the Knapsack problem. To test them:

   - g++ main.cpp -o knapsack

   - ./knapsack < input.txt


This describes the Knapsack algorithm and the optimal path allowing us to determine which items exactly we have to take out.
The algorithm is written in C++, however, to play with SWIG, you can call the libraries in Python!

Just execute ./script.sh and then, either launch 'python test.py', or your own python script.


(Still in trial...)
